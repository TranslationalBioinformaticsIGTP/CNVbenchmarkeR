# Dataset used for algorithm optimization
dataset:

    bed_file: "/yourPath/bed5.bed"   # bed file defining ROIs. It must be sortered by chr and start position, and 4th column must contain only gene symbol. (See examples folder)
    fasta_file: "/yourPath/GRCh37_Ensembl_67.fa"   # genome fasta file
    validated_results_file: "/yourPath/MLPAresults.txt"    # file containing results obtained using a orthogonal method (MLPA or aCGH) (See examples folder)
    validated_results_file_format: "icr"   # format of validated results files: icr or panelcn
    read_length: 101   # read length used when sequencing
